## Workings
This code may be used in any way, shape or shitty form.
The code simulates a joystick, which is connected to pins
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of PORTD on the Arduino/Atmel
The Joystick is active low, so the ports are kept high.
We do not use the dreadful fucking shitty digitalWrite, that's for kids!
We use the PORTD RAW as ATMEL intended it!
