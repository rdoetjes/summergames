Callous Coder, creates a machine based on Arduino to beat the 100M Dash record on C64 SUMMER GAMES


SUMMER GAMES 100M DASH RECORD SHATTERING MACHINE!
by Callous Coder, 2021 https://youtube.com/callouscoder

This code may be used in any way, shape or shitty form.
The code simulates a joystick, which is connected to pins
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of PORTD on the Arduino/Atmel
The Joystick is active low, so the ports are kept high.
We do not use the dreadful fucking shitty digitalWrite, that's for kids!
We use the PORTD RAW as ATMEL intended it!
